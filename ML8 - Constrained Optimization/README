# Module: Machine Learning - Constrained Optimization

## Outline
This course will cover:
* Convex constrained problems and the CVXPY library
* Penalty method to approximate constraints with non-convex solvers
* Projected Gradient Descent method to approximate constraints with non-convex solvers

## Excercises & Tasks

There is one notebook to be completed, where the missing code is denoted by the comment *#TOFILL*.
